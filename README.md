# Brain tumor detection

## Introduction
> According to the american National Brain Tumor Society([Link](https://braintumor.org/brain-tumors/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-facts/#:~:text=Today%2C%20an%20estimated%20700%2C000%20people,patient%20and%20their%20loved%20ones.)) 700,000 peaople in the US having a primary brain tumor and in the year 2022 approximatly 89,000 will receive a tumor diagnose and in this  [article](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/brain-cancer-us-ageing-population/#:~:text=GlobalData%20epidemiologists%20forecast%20an%20increase,(AGR)%20of%201.50%25.)  they are claiming that the number of diagnosed cases will increase from 27,000 in 2020 to 31,000 in 2030 in the US.

> In general, spotting cancer early increases the chances of survival, says the Cacer Research UK  [(Link)](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-symptoms/why-is-early-diagnosis-important)  and with increasing numbers it is important to find solutions for early, precise and fast tumor detection. AI and especially Deep Learning is increaingly included in the medical diagnosis processes and the advantages of image classification with deep learning can be used to make the diagnosis task more efficient. Instead of a doctor going through all the scans of a MRT a deep learning network could do a pre selection and the doctor would just need to watch through a few scans instead of the whole batch.
